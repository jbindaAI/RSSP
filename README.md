## Overview
This repository contains the final project for Architecture of large projects in bioinformatics class. The goal of this project is to create an application that facilitates the prediction of RNA secondary structures using various tools. This application integrates MXFold2, KnotFold, and RNAFold, providing a unified interface for users to input RNA sequences, run predictions, and visualize the results.


## Features
- **RNA Sequence Input**: Load RNA sequences from FASTA file or enter sequences directly in FASTA format.
- **Tool Integration**: Seamlessly run MXFold2, KnotFold, and RNAFold on the input sequences.
- **Dot-Bracket Notation**: Display the predictions in dot-bracket format for easy analysis.
- **Result Visualization**: Generate visualizations to help interpret the predicted RNA secondary structures.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface for running predictions and viewing results.
